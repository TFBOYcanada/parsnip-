ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Organization A-Fem Medical Corporation (the Company or A-Fem) is a women's health care company. A-Fem has developed three core product technology platforms, one based on its inSync(TM) miniform interlabial pad, another based on the Rapid-Sense(TM) diagnostic products and a third based on the Padkit(TM) collection device. The miniform is a new type of feminine hygiene product that is worn interlabially. AFem's first miniform application, the inSync(TM) miniform, has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and was launched in a market roll-out in Oregon and Washington in January 1998. The Company expects to use its Rapid-Sense diagnostic technology to create rapid response, low cost, point-of-use diagnostic tools which generate quantifiable results. The core technology development for Rapid-Sense(TM) diagnostic products has been completed and applications are under development. The Padkit(TM) contains a miniform to be used during a woman's menstrual cycle to collect a sample for diagnostic testing. The Company has experienced significant operating losses during the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 and has continued to incur losses into the first quarter of 1998. Further, the Company has not generated significant revenues. The Company expects that significant ongoing expenditures will be necessary to successfully implement its business plan and develop, manufacture and market its products. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Execution of the Company's plans and its ability to continue as a going concern depend upon its acquiring substantial additional financing. Management's plans include efforts to obtain additional capital and to evaluate potential partnering opportunities. The Company has demonstrated the ability to raise operating funds in the past by securing investment commitments in its common stock of approximately $1.8 million during 1997 and raising over $1.9 million in equity financing from various groups of private investors during 1996; however, there can be no assurance that the Company's efforts to raise additional funding or enter into a strategic alliance will be successful. If the company is unable to obtain adequate additional financing, enter into such strategic alliance or generate sufficient profitable sales revenues, management may be required to curtail the Company's product development, marketing activities and other operations and the Company may be forced to cease operations. Fair Value The carrying value of financial instruments approximates fair value, unless otherwise disclosed. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents cash required to satisfy the Company's contractual obligation for salary and related benefits associated with the hiring of the Director of Sales and Marketing. Concentration of Risk The Company currently purchases certain raw materials from a single supplier. Management believes that other suppliers could supply these products, but there is no assurance that such a change in suppliers would not adversely impact the terms currently received by the Company. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis and market based on the lower of replacement cost or estimated realizable value. Property, Equipment and Furniture Property, equipment and furniture are recorded at cost, except for assets acquired in the acquisition noted above which are recorded at estimated fair value, and depreciated on a straight-line basis over useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lives of the related leases. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred; renewals and betterments are capitalized. Patents Patent costs are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over a 17year period beginning with the date the patent is granted. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). Under SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax effected difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount for financial reporting purposes, referred to as "temporary differences," using enacted marginal income tax rates. Net Loss per Share Beginning December 31, 1997, basic earnings per share (EPS) and diluted EPS are required to be computed using the methods prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, "Earnings per Share" (SFAS 128). Basic EPS is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period and diluted EPS is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding. Prior period amounts have been restated to conform with the presentation requirements of SFAS 128. Following is a reconciliation of basic EPS and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31: 1997 1996 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------Per Per Share Share Income Shares Amount Income Shares Amount ----------------------------------------------------Basic EPS: Income available to Common Shareholders $(1,993,674) 11,682,687 $(4,333,114) 9,183,085 $(.47) Effect of dilutive securities: Stock options --------------------------$(.17) ---------------------------Diluted EPS: Income available to Common Shareholders $(1,993,674) 11,682,687 $(.17) $(4,333,114) 9,183,085 $(.47) =========== =========== ==== =========== =========== ==== Stock options, warrants and convertible debentures have not been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding because their effect would be antidilutive. Supplemental Cash Flow Disclosure Total cash paid for interest was $70,199 and $38,761 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements required the use of certain estimates by management in determining the recorded amounts of the Company's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. 2.

OBLIGATIONS UNDER CAPITAL LEASES: Certain collateralized equipment is leased by the Company, which obligations are reflected by the secured leases as noted below. This equipment is used for the research and development of new products and for the manufacturing and production of the miniform. Future minimum lease payments under capital leases as of December 31 are as follows: 1998 $ 318,465 1999 200,403 2000 37,253 2001 4,777 --------Total minimum lease payments 560,898 Less-Amount representing interest (at rates ranging from 6.24% to 18.44%) (76,769) --------Present value of minimum lease payments 484,129 Less-Current portion (262,772) --------$ 221,357 ========= 5. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY: Common Stock Options During 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Incentive and Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the Incentive Plan), under which 3,300,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance under qualified options, nonqualified options, stock appreciation rights and other awards as set forth in the Incentive Plan. The Incentive Plan provides for administration by a Committee comprised of not less than two members of the Company's Board of Directors. Such Committee (or the Board of Directors in its absence) determines the number of shares, option price, duration and other terms of the options granted under the Incentive Plan. Qualified options are available for issuance to employees of the Company.

The warrants may be exercised for shares of the Company's Common Stock. The following summarizes outstanding warrants for shares of the Company's Common Stock: Shares Weighted Average Subject to Exercise Price Warrants Per Share -----------Balance at December 31, 1995 3,297,900 $1.65 Warrants granted 325,000 4.45 Warrants exercised (266,650) 1.01 Warrants canceled (5,000) 4.00 -------------Balance at December 31, 1996 3,351,250 1.96 Warrants granted 50,000 2.00 Warrants exercised (866,500) 0.70 Warrants canceled (48,334) 3.02 --------------Balance at December 31, 1997 2,486,416 $2.39 ========= ===== Number exercisable at December 31, 1997 2,486,416 $2.39 During February 1997, the Company granted warrants for 50,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock to an investor in the Company. The warrants are exercisable at a price of $2.00 per share and expire in January 2002. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 During 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123 which defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option and similar equity instruments and encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting for all of their employee stock compensation plans. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans using the method of accounting prescribed by APB 25. Entities electing to remain with the accounting in APB 25 must make pro forma disclosures of net income and, if presented, earnings per share, as if the fair value based method of accounting defined in SFAS 123 had been adopted. The Company has elected to account for its stock-based compensation plan under APB 25; however, the Company has computed, for pro forma disclosure purposes, the value of all options granted during 1997 and 1996 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as prescribed by SFAS 123 using the following weighted average assumptions for grants: For the Year Ended December 31, 1997 1996 Average risk-free interest rate 6.00% 6.37% Expected dividend yield --Expected lives 6 years 6 years Expected volatility 83.30% 93.67% Using the Black-Scholes methodology, the total value of options granted during 1997 and 1996 was $1,399,835 and $550,750, respectively, which would be amortized on a pro forma basis over the vesting period of the options (typically four years). The weighted average fair value of options granted during 1997 and 1996 was $2.35 per share and $3.15 per share, respectively. If the Company had accounted for its stock-based compensation plan in accordance with SFAS 123, the Company's net loss and net loss per share would approximate the pro forma disclosures below: 1997 1996 --------------------------As Reported Pro Forma As Reported Pro Forma Net loss $(1,993,674) $(2,660,895) $(4,333,114) $(4,650,377) Net loss per share (.17) (.23) (.47) (.51) The effects of applying SFAS 123 in this pro forma disclosure are not indicative of future amounts SFAS 123 does not apply to awards prior to January 1, 1995 and additional awards are anticipated in future years. 6. INCOME TAXES: As of December 31, 1997, the Company had federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $9,804,957. If not applied against future taxable income, the federal NOL carryforwards will expire in the years 2001 through 2011. Changes in the Company's ownership have caused an annual limitation on the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized and start-up costs that can be amortized. As of December 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had net deferred tax assets of approximately $3.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively, primarily resulting from deferred startup costs and NOL carryforwards. In accordance with SFAS 109, at December 31, 1997 and 1996 a valuation allowance was recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to zero. 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Employment Contract The Company has an employment contract with an officer, who is also a director of the Company. Under terms of the contract as amended, the Company committed to pay an annual salary for the five-year period ending June 30, 1998. As of December 31, 1997, salary related to this contract totaled approximately $115,000 and, under terms of the contract, may be increased in the future. Operating Leases As of March 1996, the Company relocated its corporate office and product development facilities to 7,100 square feet of leased space within the same business park as its former office. In addition, the Company leases its warehouse and manufacturing facilities in the same business park. Other leases have terms of one year or less. Future minimum lease payments for office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities at December 31, 1997 totaled $241,931 and are payable as follows: 1998 $153,497 1999 71,380 2000 12,975 2001 4,079 Rent expense was $119,421 and $127,338 for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Litigation During 1995, the Company was named as a defendant in a civil action brought in the Circuit Court of Oregon for Washington County by Kassia International Incorporated (the Plaintiff). The complaint alleged that the Company breached its obligations to complete the purchase of the Plaintiff in the spring of 1995 and sought damages of up to $6 million under various theories. During 1996, a settlement agreement was reached. The Company paid certain expenses of Kassia of $90,000, of which $50,000 was covered by insurance, and issued 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock as consideration for certain proprietary assets of the Plaintiff. The fair market value of the stock was $2.00 at the date of settlement. 8. LICENSING AGREEMENT: On April 28, 1997, the Company entered into a license agreement with a major manufacturer and distributor of consumer products to make, use and sell the Company's interlabial products and to use certain of the Company's trademarks. The Company received $2 million upon signing this agreement, with an additional $2 million to be received over the term of the agreement if certain milestones are achieved. 9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT: Financing Commitment During the first quarter of 1998, in various transactions, the Company issued 520,833 shares of the Company's Common Stock in exchange for $1,000,000 in cash from a group of private investors. The financing is intended to assist in meeting the Company's operating needs while it pursues additional sources of financing.
